I am a retired fed - including someyears as MMS deputy and acting director.  I observe the OCS profrgam because I remain interested and do some pro bono consulting for organizations and individuals interested in oceans and their management. I need access to overall generic and public data on all offshore revenues, by calendar or fiscal year.  This includes revenues from OCS wind leases.  Can you provide such access?  Thank you.
