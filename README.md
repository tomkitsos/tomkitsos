I am a retired fed - sometime as MMS deputy and acting director.  I observe the OCS profrgam because I am interested and do some pro bono consulting for an organization with members interested in oceans and thier management. I need access to overall generic data on all offshore revenues, by calendar or fiscal year.  This includes revenues form OCS wind leases.  Can you provide such access?  Thank you.
